# WorldBank-Global-Inflation-Data

This repository contains processed [data](data) versions of the World Bank's ["_A Global Database of Inflation_"](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/brief/inflation-database) inflation data. The information has been structured and cleaned for enhanced usability in AI, machine learning, and data science applications. No scripts or code are included in this repository; only the processed datasets are provided.

To access and use the data files in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/WorldBank-Global-Inflation-Data.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd WorldBank-Global-Inflation-Data
   ```
   
## Explore the SQLite Database

Besides the .csv content found in the [data](data) directory, the data is also provided in SQLite format as `world_bank_inflation.db` for efficient querying and analysis. Below are some nifty functions to use for some data surfing. 

### Open the Database (Command Line):
   Use the SQLite command-line interface or any SQLite-compatible tool:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 world_bank_inflation.db
   ```

   ### List Available Tables (SQL Queries):
   ```sql
   .tables
   ```
   ### Retrieve all countries present for a specific table (SQL Queries):
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT country_code, country FROM producer_price_index_quarterly_data;
   ```
   Replace `producer_price_index_quarterly_data` and `country_code, country` with the relevant table and column names for your analysis.

   ### Retrieve data from a specific country (SQL Queries):
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM headline_cpi_monthly_data WHERE country_code = 'USA';
   ```

### Python Example:
   Use SQLite in Python with the `sqlite3` library:
   ```python
   import sqlite3

   # Connect to the database
   conn = sqlite3.connect('world_bank_inflation.db')
   cursor = conn.cursor()

   # Execute a query
   cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM headline_cpi_monthly_data WHERE country_code = 'USA'")
   rows = cursor.fetchall()

   # Close the connection
   conn.close()
   ```

### Example Scripts

For clear, code-ready demonstrations of how to load, filter, and work with both the CSV files and the SQLite database, please check out the [`examples/`](examples) directory. These snippets illustrate how to treat the data programmatically using Python and pandas, including caveats about partial country coverage across datasets.
